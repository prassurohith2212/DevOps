. A continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is a series of steps that must be performed in order 
  to deliver a new version of software. CI/CD pipelines are a practice focused on improving software delivery throughout  
  the software development life cycle via automation. 

.By automating CI/CD throughout development, testing, production, and monitoring phases of the software development lifecycle, 
 organizations are able to develop higher quality code, faster. Although itâ€™s possible to manually execute each of the steps of
 a CI/CD pipeline, the true value of CI/CD pipelines is realized through automation.
