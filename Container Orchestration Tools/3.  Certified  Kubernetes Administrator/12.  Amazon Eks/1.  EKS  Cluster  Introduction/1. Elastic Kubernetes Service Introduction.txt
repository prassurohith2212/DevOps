1. Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services :
========================================

1.1. What is Amazon EKS?
===========================
- Amazon EKS is a managed service that helps make it easier to run Kubernetes on AWS. 
- Through EKS, organizations can run Kubernetes without installing and operating a Kubernetes control plane or worker nodes. 
- Simply put, EKS is a managed containers-as-a-service (CaaS) that drastically simplifies Kubernetes deployment on AWS.

1.2. How  EKS Works ?
=======================
- The simplest way to look at EKS is that it’s AWS’ offering for Kubernetes-as-a-service. 
- As mentioned, EKS significantly simplifies the management and maintenance of highly-available Kubernetes clusters in AWS.


1.3. Eks Components:
=======================
- In each EKS cluster are two main components: Control Plane and Worker Nodes.

1.Control Plane:
================
. The Control Plane consists of three Kubernetes master nodes that run in three different availability zones (AZs). 
. All incoming traffic to Kubernetes API comes through the network load balancer (NLB). 
. It runs on the virtual private cloud controlled by Amazon. 
. Hence, the Control Panel can’t be managed directly by the organization and is fully managed by AWS.


2. Worker Nodes:
==================
. Worner Nodes run on the Amazon EC2 instances in the virtual private cloud controlled by the organization. 
. Any instance in AWS can be used as a worker node. These worker nodes can be accessed through SSH or provisioned without automation.
. A cluster of worker nodes runs an organization’s containers while the control plane manages and monitors when and where containers are started.
. Due to the flexibility of the EKS layout, organizations can deploy a Kubernetes cluster (an EKS cluster) for each application. 
. Organizations can also use just one EKS cluster to run more than one application via Kubernetes namespaces and AWS IAM configurations.

Note: Worker Nodes can be deployed as 3 ways  1. Self Managed Nodes,  2. Managed Node Group,  3. Fragate Services.

1.4. AWS EKS Pricing:
=====================
. Amazon AWS EKS uses a simple pricing model of $0.10 per hour for each EKS cluster you create. 
. You can run a single AWS EKS cluster on multiple applications, or you can run EKS on AWS with either EC2 or Fargate.



1.5. Eks integrate with AWS services:
=======================================
- IAM
- Cloud Watch
- EFS
- EBS
- VPC 
- ALB
- ELB
- NLB
