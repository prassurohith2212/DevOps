2. Container Storage Interface :
=================================
- In the past k8 users docker alone as a container runtime engine & all code works with docker is embedded to k8 source code.
- When new container runtime came its imp to support to those RKT, CRI-O & to work with diff CRE & not Dependent on k8 Source Code.
- Thats how CRI Came.


- Its a standard that defines how an orchestration solutions like kubernetes communicate CRE like Docker.
- In Future any New CRE Developed they can simply follows CRI.Standards & New CRE Should work with k8's without interacting with k8 developers or touch the k8 source code.
- All or any CRE follows CNI & Creates their code & it works for k8.
- CSI was Developed to support multiple storage solution.
Ex: portworks, Amazon EBS, DELEMC, GlusterFS.
- with CSI you can write own drivers to your own solution.
