6. Git Clone:
==============

. We have a bare repository on the Git server and Tom also pushed his first version. 
. Now, Jerry can view his changes. The Clone operation creates an instance of the remote repository.

. Jerry creates a new directory in his home directory and performs the clone operation.


# mkdir hello-world
# cd  hello-world  

# git remote add origin https://github.com/prassurohith/hello-world.git
# git push -u origin master

Note: Above Activity can download all source code to local from remote repository.


# git status -s 

# ls -larth
