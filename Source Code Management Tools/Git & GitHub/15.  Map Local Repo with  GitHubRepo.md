1. Map local repo with GitHub repo:
===================================
. Lets assume a developer one have a local repo and having all source code in it. Now he wants to share a source code to developer2.
. developer1 did "git add.",  "git commit -m "commit","git push origin" wont work out since there is no base remote repo for this push.

Resolution:
----------- 
. create a new repository in github.
. and follow instruction to add a remote repo.
