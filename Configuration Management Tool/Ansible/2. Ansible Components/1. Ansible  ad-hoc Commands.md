# 1. Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands :

## 1.1. What is Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands :

- An Ansible ad hoc command uses the /usr/bin/ansible command-line tool to automate a single task on one or more managed nodes. 



## 1.2. Why use of Ad-Hoc Commands :

- ad hoc commands are great for tasks you repeat rarely.

- For example, if you want to power off all the machines in your lab for Divali vacation, you could execute a quick one-liner in 
  Ansible without writing a playbook.
  
- An ad hoc command looks like this:  ansible [pattern] -m [module] -a "[module options]"
 

## 1.3.Use cases for ad hoc tasks:

- ad hoc tasks can be used to reboot servers, copy files, manage packages and users, and much more. 
- You can use any Ansible module in an ad hoc task. 
- ad hoc tasks, like playbooks, use a declarative model, calculating and executing the actions required to reach a specified final state. 
- They achieve a form of idempotence by checking the current state before they begin and doing nothing unless the current state is different 
  from the specified final state.
  

### Example Ad-Hoc Commands :

#### Rebooting Servers:


- ansible <Group/Host> -a "/sbin/reboot"
- ansible <Group/Host> -a "/sbin/reboot" -f 10
- ansible <Group/Host> -a "/sbin/reboot" -f 10 -u username
- ansible <Group/Host> -a "/sbin/reboot" -f 10 -u username --become [--ask-become-pass]
