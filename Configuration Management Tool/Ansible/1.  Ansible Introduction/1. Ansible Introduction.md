# 1. Ansible Introduction:

## 1.1. What is Ansible ?

- Ansible is simple open source IT engine which automates application deployment, intra service orchestration, cloud provisioning 
  and many other IT tools.
- Ansible is easy to deploy because it does not use any agents or custom security infrastructure.

### YAML Usecase in Ansible:

- Ansible uses playbook to describe automation jobs, and playbook uses very simple language i.e. YAML
- YAML (Itâ€™s a human-readable data serialization language & is commonly used for configuration files, 
  but could be used in many applications where data is being stored)


## 1.2. How Ansible Works :
- Ansible manages your inventory in simple text files (These are the hosts file). 
- Ansible uses the hosts file where one can group the hosts and can control the actions on a specific group in the playbooks.
- Ansible is completely agentless which means Ansible works by connecting your nodes through ssh(by default).
- Ansible works by connecting to your nodes and pushing out small programs, called "Ansible modules" to them. 
- Ansible then executes these modules (over SSH by default), and removes them when finished. 
- Your library of modules can reside on any machine, and there are no servers, daemons, or databases required.

### 1. Control Node: 
- Managed node where ansible installed.

### 2. Managed Nodes:
- Host Servers that you managed with Ansible Managed Server.

### 3. Inventory:
- List of Managed Nodes.
- An inventory file is also sometimes called a "Hostfile".

### 4.Modules:
- Units of code that ansible executes. each module has a particular functionality.

### 5. Tasks:
- The units of actions in Ansible.

### 6. PlayBooks:
