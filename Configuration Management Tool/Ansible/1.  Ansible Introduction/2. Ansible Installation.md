# 2. Ansible Installation:
- Ansible is an open-source automation platform. It is very, very simple to set up and yet powerful. Ansible can help you with configuration management, application   deployment, task automation.

## 2.1. Managed  Ansible Node  Installation steps:

## 2.1. Master Node Installation steps:
+ on Amazon EC2 instance:

### 1. Install python and python-pip

          yum install python
          yum install python-pip

### 2. Install ansible using pip check for version

          pip install ansible
          ansible --version

### 3. Create a user called ansadmin (on Control node and Managed host)

          useradd ansadmin
          passwd ansadmin

### 4. Below command grant sudo access to ansadmin user. But we strongly recommended using "visudo" command if you are aware vi or nano editor. (on Control node and        Managed host)

        
        echo "ansadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers

### 5. Log in as a ansadmin user on master and generate ssh key (on Control node)

        ssh-keygen

### 6. Copy keys onto all ansible managed hosts (on Control node)

        ssh-copy-id ansadmin@<target-server>

### 7. Ansible server used to create images and store on docker registry. Hence install docker, start docker services and add ansadmin to the docker group.

       yum install docker

       # start docker services 
         service docker start
         service docker start 

       # add user to docker group 
         usermod -aG docker ansadmin

### 8. Create a directory /etc/ansible and create an inventory file called "hosts" add control node and managed hosts IP addresses to it.

### Validation test
- Run ansible command as ansadmin user it should be successful (Master)


    '''
    
        ansible all -m ping
 
    '''
  


## 2.2. Setup & Add Remote Host of Linux Server to Managed Ansible Server :

### 1. Setup an Ec2 Instances of Managed Hosts.

- Create an Ec2 Instances of Managed Hosts.

### 2. Setup HostName 

   '''
   
       hostnamectl set-hostname  Managed-Host-1
   
   '''
  
 ### 3. Create an ansadmin user:
 
    '''
         useradd ansadmin
         passwd ansadmin
  
    '''
  
 ### 4. Add user to Sudoers File:
 
    '''
    
       echo "ansadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
    
    '''
 
 ### 5. Enable Password Based Authentication:
 
 - Enable password based authentification in ec2 machines in sshd_config.
 

## 2.3. Master server integration with Client Server:
 
### 1. Linux Server :
    

'''
    
       ssh-copy-id  ansadmin@<Client-Server-Ip-Address>
       ssh ansadmin@<Client-Server-Ip-Address>
       
'''
