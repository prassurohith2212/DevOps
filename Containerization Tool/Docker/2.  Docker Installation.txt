Docker Installation On CentOS 7:
=================================

Step 1: Install and Configure Docker:
--------------------------------------
1. Earlier versions of Docker were called docker or docker-engine, if you have these installed, you must uninstall them before 
   installing a newer docker-ce version.

# yum remove docker docker-client docker-client-latest docker-common docker-latest docker-latest-logrotate docker-logrotate docker-engine



2. To install the latest version of the Docker Engine you need to set up the Docker repository and install the yum-utils 
   package to enable Docker stable repository on the system.
   
# yum install -y yum-utils
# yum-config-manager --add-repo  https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo



3. Now install the newer docker-ce version from the Docker repository and containerd manually, because due to some issues, 
   Red Hat blocked the installation of containerd.io > 1.2.0-3.el7, which is a dependency of docker-ce.
   
# yum install https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/7/x86_64/stable/Packages/containerd.io-1.2.6-3.3.el7.x86_64.rpm
# yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli


4. After, Docker package has been installed, start the daemon, check its status and enable it system-wide using the below commands:

# systemctl start docker 
# systemctl status docker
# systemctl enable docker

5. Finally, run a container test image to verify if Docker works properly, by issuing the following command:

# docker run hello-world

. If you can see the below message, then everything is in the right place


# Verify :
-----------
# docker version
# doecker info
