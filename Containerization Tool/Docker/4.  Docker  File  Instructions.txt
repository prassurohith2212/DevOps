8. Docker File instructions:
=============================

1. FROM
--------
. FROM must be the first non-comment instruction in the Dockerfile.
. FROM can appear multiple times within a single Dockerfile in order to create multiple images. 
  Simply make a note of the last image ID output by the commit before each new FROM command.
. The tag or digest values are optional. If you omit either of them, the builder assumes a latest by default. 
  The builder returns an error if it cannot match the tag value.


Usage:

FROM <image>
FROM <image>:<tag>
FROM <image>@<digest>

2. MAINTAINER
--------------
. The MAINTAINER instruction allows you to set the Author field of the generated images.

MAINTAINER <name>


3. RUN
-------
. The exec form makes it possible to avoid shell string munging, and to RUN commands using a base image that does not contain the specified shell executable.
. The default shell for the shell form can be changed using the SHELL command.
. Normal shell processing does not occur when using the exec form. 
. For example, RUN ["echo", "$HOME"] will not do variable substitution on $HOME.

Usage:

RUN <command> (shell form, the command is run in a shell, which by default is /bin/sh -c on Linux or cmd /S /C on Windows)
RUN ["<executable>", "<param1>", "<param2>"] (exec form)


4. CMD:
--------
. The main purpose of a CMD is to provide defaults for an executing container. These defaults can include an executable, or they can omit the executable, 
  in which case you must specify an ENTRYPOINT instruction as well.
. There can only be one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile. If you list more than one CMD then only the last CMD will take effect.
. If CMD is used to provide default arguments for the ENTRYPOINT instruction, both the CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions should be specified with the JSON array format.
. If the user specifies arguments to docker run then they will override the default specified in CMD.
. Normal shell processing does not occur when using the exec form. For example, CMD ["echo", "$HOME"] will not do variable substitution on $HOME.

Usage:

CMD ["<executable>","<param1>","<param2>"] (exec form, this is the preferred form)
CMD ["<param1>","<param2>"] (as default parameters to ENTRYPOINT)
CMD <command> <param1> <param2> (shell form)



5. EXPOSE:
-----------
. Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network port(s) at runtime.
. EXPOSE does not make the ports of the container accessible to the host.

Usage:

EXPOSE <port> [<port> ...]


6. ENV :
---------
. The ENV instruction sets the environment variable <key> to the value <value>.
. The value will be in the environment of all “descendant” Dockerfile commands and can be replaced inline as well.
. The environment variables set using ENV will persist when a container is run from the resulting image.
. The first form will set a single variable to a value with the entire string after the first space being treated as the <value> - 
  including characters such as spaces and quotes.


Usage:

ENV <key> <value>
ENV <key>=<value> [<key>=<value> ...]


7. COPY:
----------
. Copies new files or directories from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the image at the path <dest>.
. <src> may contain wildcards and matching will be done using Go’s filepath.Match rules.
. <src> must be relative to the source directory that is being built (the context of the build).
. <dest> is an absolute path, or a path relative to WORKDIR.
. If <dest> doesn’t exist, it is created along with all missing directories in its path.

Usage:

COPY <src> [<src> ...] <dest>
COPY ["<src>", ... "<dest>"] (this form is required for paths containing whitespace)


8. USER:
---------
. The USER instruction sets the user name or UID to use when running the image and for any RUN, CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile.


Usage:

USER <username | UID>


9. SHELL: 
----------
. Allows the default shell used for the shell form of commands to be overridden.
. Each SHELL instruction overrides all previous SHELL instructions, and affects all subsequent instructions.
. Allows an alternate shell be used such as zsh, csh, tcsh, powershell, and others.

Usage:

SHELL ["<executable>", "<param1>", "<param2>"]
